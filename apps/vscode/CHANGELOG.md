The Mind Palace Observer is your IDE's "Head-Up Display" for the Mind Palace ecosystem. It bridges the gap between your local source code and your digital second brain.

### Key Features

#### The Traffic Light (Status HUD)

- **Real-time Health Monitoring**: A status bar indicator that reflects the "freshness" of your codebase index.
- **Smart Healing**: One-click (or auto-save) synchronization that ensures AI agents always see the current state of your code.

#### The Blueprint Sidebar

- **Project Structure Explorer**: High-fidelity tree navigation curated by the Palace.
- **Interactive Knowledge View**: Browse, search, and manage project Ideas, Decisions, and Learnings without leaving your editor.
- **Session Tracker**: Real-time view of AI agent sessions and their activity history.

#### Deep Editor Integration

- **Hybrid Semantic Search**: A powerful search interface combining keyword match with AI-powered embedding search.
- **Inline Decorations**: Subtle visual cues for code associated with specific project learnings or decisions.
- **Interactive Call Graphs**: Visualize complex symbol relationships directly in the side panel.

#### Command Palette Mastery

- **`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+H`**: Instantly heal (scan & collect) the current workspace.
- **`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+K`**: Quick-store any selected text as a new project Idea or Learning.
- **`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F`**: Global hybrid search for project knowledge.
