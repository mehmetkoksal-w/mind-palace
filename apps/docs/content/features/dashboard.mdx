### Learnings

Browse and search captured learnings.

**Features:**
- View all learnings
- Filter by scope (file/room/palace)
- Search by content
- See confidence scores
- View use counts
- Track learning sources

### File Intelligence

Heat map visualization of file activity.

**Three View Modes:**

1. **Heat Map**: Visual grid showing edit frequency
   - Color intensity indicates edit count
   - Red border indicates files with failures
   - Click to see file details

2. **List View**: Sorted list of files
   - Shows edit counts and failure rates
   - Progress bars for visual comparison
   - Separate section for fragile files

3. **Tree View**: Hierarchical file browser
   - Navigate folder structure
   - Color-coded by activity level
   - Expand/collapse folders

**Metrics Shown:**
- Total files tracked
- Total edits
- Fragile files (high failure rate)
- Total failures

### Corridors

Manage cross-project knowledge sharing.

**Features:**
- View personal corridor stats
- See linked workspaces

## Configuration

Dashboard settings in `palace.jsonc`:

```json
{
  "dashboard": {
    "port": 3001,
    "autoOpen": true,
    "theme": "dark"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Won't Start

1. Check if port is in use: `lsof -i :3001`
2. Try a different port: `palace dashboard --port 3002`
3. Check for errors in terminal output

### No Data Showing

1. Ensure you've run `palace scan` first
2. Verify `.palace/index/palace.db` exists
3. Check the backend is running and accessible

### Slow Performance

1. Large codebases may take time to load
2. Consider filtering or limiting results
3. Check browser developer console for errors
