# Migration Guide

Since this is the **initial pre-release** of Mind Palace, there are no prior versions to migrate from. Welcome to the baseline!

---

## v0.0.1-alpha

This release serves as the **Standard Baseline** for the Mind Palace ecosystem.

### Starting Fresh

To ensure a clean experience with the initial release:

1.  **Install the CLI**: Download and install the `palace` binary.
2.  **Initialize**: Run `palace init` in your project root.
3.  **Indexing**: Run `palace scan` to build your first structural index.

### Future Migrations

Starting from `v0.0.1-alpha`, all breaking changes in schemas, database formats, or command-line interfaces will be meticulously documented here. We adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) to ensure your workflows remain predictable.
