# Introduction

Mind Palace is a deterministic context system for codebases. Unlike RAG or embedding-based approaches, Mind Palace provides **schema-validated, verifiable context** that both humans and AI agents can trust.

## Installation

### macOS / Linux

```sh
# Download the latest release
curl -L https://github.com/koksalmehmet/mind-palace/releases/latest/download/palace-darwin-arm64 -o palace

# Make it executable
chmod +x palace

# Move to your PATH
sudo mv palace /usr/local/bin/
```

### Windows

Download from the [releases page](https://github.com/koksalmehmet/mind-palace/releases) and add to your PATH.

### Verify Installation

```sh
palace version
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Your Project

```sh
cd your-project
palace init
```

This creates the `.palace/` directory with:
- `palace.jsonc` - Project configuration
- `rooms/` - Room definitions
- `playbooks/` - Workflow templates

### 2. Build the Index

```sh
palace scan
```

This creates a SQLite database with full-text search (FTS5) containing:
- File metadata and hashes
- Symbols (functions, types, classes)
- Call relationships

### 3. Query Your Codebase

```sh
palace query "where is authentication handled"
```

Results are ranked using BM25 with entry-point boosting.

### 4. Generate Context for AI Agents

```sh
palace context "fix the login bug"
```

This creates a context pack with relevant files, rooms, and metadata.
