  "explore": "🟡 **IMPORTANT** Search the codebase by intent or keywords. Returns ranked results grouped by 'Rooms' (conceptual areas of the project).\n\n**WHEN TO USE:**\n- When user asks: \"where is X?\", \"find the code for Y\", \"show me Z implementation\"\n- When starting exploration of unfamiliar codebase areas\n- When user mentions feature names, technical concepts, or business logic without file paths\n- Examples: \"where is authentication?\", \"find payment processing\", \"show error handling\"\n\n**AUTONOMOUS BEHAVIOR:**\nUse proactively when the user's question implies location discovery but doesn't provide specific file paths. If the user mentions a feature/concept name without context, automatically search before asking for clarification. This is your primary discovery tool.\n\n**BEST FOR:**\nInitial discovery and location finding when you don't know where code lives. Use this as your first step when exploring new areas or when file paths are unknown.\n\n**PARAMETERS:**\n- query: Natural language ('where is auth logic') or code symbols ('handleAuth', 'AuthService')\n- limit: Maximum results (default: 10, max: 50)\n- room: Optional filter to specific Room\n- fuzzy: Enable typo tolerance (default: false)",

  "explore_rooms": "🔴 **CRITICAL** List all available Rooms in the Mind Palace.

Do not wait for user request. This provides essential context for all other operations. Think of this as \"loading the map\" before exploration.\n\n**BEST FOR:**\nGetting the high-level conceptual map of the codebase. This is your foundation - call it first to understand the project's mental model and available areas. Essential for orientation.\n\n**PARAMETERS:**\nNone - returns complete room listing.",

  "explore_context": "🔴 **CRITICAL** Get complete context for a task. Returns all relevant files, symbols, imports, decisions, learnings, and ideas.\n\n**WHEN TO USE:**\n- When user asks to implement a feature, fix a bug, or make changes\n- Before writing any significant code changes\n- When user asks: \"how do I implement X?\", \"what do I need to know about Y?\", \"show me everything related to Z\"\n- When you need comprehensive understanding before taking action\n- Examples: \"add user authentication\", \"fix the login bug\", \"understand payment flow\"\n\n**AUTONOMOUS BEHAVIOR:**\nALWAYS use automatically before implementing features or making changes. Do not wait for explicit request - this is your \"gather intel before action\" step. Call this proactively when the user's intent involves modification or implementation.\n\n**BEST FOR:**\nPre-implementation research and comprehensive context gathering. Use this when you need everything relevant to accomplish a task, not just find code location. This returns the full working set.\n\n**PARAMETERS:**\n- task: Task description (e.g., 'add user authentication', 'fix login bug')\n- limit: Max files/symbols (default: 20)\n- maxTokens: Token budget for response\n- includeTests: Include test files (default: false)\n- includeLearnings: Include session memory learnings (default: true)\n- includeFileIntel: Include edit history, failure rates (default: true)\n- includeIdeas: Include relevant ideas (default: true)\n- includeDecisions: Include relevant decisions (default: true)",
